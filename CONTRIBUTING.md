# Format code with Black
black .

# Check with flake8
flake8 .

# Type checking (optional)
mypy .
```

### Documentation

- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
- Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def function_name(param1: str, param2: int) -> bool:
    """Short description of function.

    Longer description if needed.

    Args:
        param1: Description of first parameter.
        param2: Description of second parameter.

    Returns:
        Description of return value.

    Raises:
        ValueError: When param1 is empty.
    """
    pass
```

### Type Hints

Use type hints for better code clarity:

```python
from typing import Dict, List, Optional

def process_data(items: List[str], config: Optional[Dict] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    pass
```
